## List the software functional requirements. Your software must have at least 9 (NINE) functional requirements and 3 (THREE) non-functional requirements. 

### Functional Requirement
1.	**User Authentication and Authorization**:
*	Users should be able to log in securely with unique credentials.
*	Different user roles (admin, manager, field worker) should have different levels of access to system functionalities.

2.	**Plantation and Tree Management**:
*	Enable the addition, modification, and deletion of plantation and tree records.
*	Provide functionalities to track plantation health, growth stages, and maintenance activities.

3.	**Employee Management**:
*	Allow administrators to add, update, and remove employee profiles.
*	Enable tracking of employee attendance, work hours, and performance evaluations.

4.	**Inventory and Supply Chain Management**:
*	Facilitate the management of inventory levels for fertilizers, pesticides, and equipment.
*	Automate procurement processes, including generating purchase orders and tracking deliveries.

5.	**Sales and Distribution**:
*	Enable the creation and management of sales orders, invoices, and customer records.
*	Provide functionalities for tracking deliveries and managing receivables.

6.	**Financial Management**:
*	Support the recording of financial transactions such as payroll, expenses, and revenue.
*	Generate financial reports like income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements.

7.	**Analytics and Reporting**:
*	Provide dashboards and reports for monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs).
*	Implement data analytics to identify trends, optimize operations, and support decision-making.

8.	**Mobile Access and Offline Functionality**:
*	Develop a mobile application for field workers to input data from the field.
*	Ensure the application works seamlessly even in offline mode, syncing data once connectivity is restored.

9.	**IoT Integratio**:
*	Real-time data collection from soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and other IoT devices.
*	Automated control of irrigation and other field operations based on sensor data.

### Non-Functional Requirements
1.	**Scalability**:
*	The system should be able to handle increased data volume and user traffic as the plantation expands.
*	It should scale horizontally by adding more servers or using cloud-based solutions.

2.	**Reliability**:
*	The system should be highly reliable, minimizing downtime and ensuring data integrity.
*	Implement redundant systems and automated backups to prevent data loss.

3.	**Performance**:
*	The system should be responsive, with low latency for user interactions.
*	Optimize database queries and implement caching mechanisms to improve performance.
