# POST - Palm Oil System Technology (POST)

Welcome to the repository for the POST - Palm Oil System Technology project. This system is designed as a comprehensive solution for managing palm oil plantations, streamlining operations from the ground up, and integrating cutting-edge technologies to enhance productivity and sustainability.

## About the Project

POST is a software engineering project aimed at creating a robust and user-friendly platform to assist in the management of palm oil plantation records and business operations. Inspired by the operational strategies of FELDA, one of the world's leading palm oil producers, our system addresses the complexities of modern plantation management through a suite of integrated modules.
